# My Dotfiles
These are my configurations for my Arch Linux Setup (currently using Dell XPS 13
Developer Edition 2015).

It relies on Stow to manage the files themselves, and my .xmonad as well as
.emacs.d are added as submodules

These dotfiles have configurations for both i3 and xmonad.

## I3
For I3, the following packages are needed:

* Dunst
* libnotify
* playerctl
* imaagemagick
* lemonbar
* my scripts package

All I3 configuration is ripped off
of [dylanaraps](https://github.com/dylanaraps/dotfiles)

## Xmonad

Look at my xmonad configuration on github.

## ZSH

My zshrc config relies on oh-my-zsh, and most likely the patched powerline fonts
since I use agnoster theme.
